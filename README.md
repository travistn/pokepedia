## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to improve my skills on handling API data and translating that data into a clean UI. I also wanted to practice another technology handling global state management other than React Context, thus the implementation of Redux Toolkit Query in the project.

## Technologies Used
* React.js
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
* React Router
* Tailwind CSS
* Redux Toolkit Query
